* High profile height of approximately 8mm or 7.5mm based on layer thickness choice
* Independent case feet system allowing for the typing angles including approximately 7° and 0°
* 10mm case corners and offset case layers 
* Large USB cutout to accommodate various cables 
* Compatible with **NORTH FACING SPACEBAR** PCBs
* Case Versions for 
    * H88 Winkey
    * H88 Winkeyless
    * H87A Winkey (Currently Testing)
    * H87A Winkeyless (Currently Testing)

*ISO and ANSI enter and left shift are in seperate plate files, however both share support for Tsangan layout* 

## Layer Breakdown 
![render img](https://github.com/audrentis/OSTKL/blob/main/doc/layerbreak.png)

## Producing this case 
* Ensure scaling is set to millimeters 
    * approximate case dimensions are 150.98 mm x 372.37 mm
* each case is divided into seperate .DXF files based on their designated layer thickness. 
    * All case layers should be 2mm thick 
        * Except for the switch plate, which should be ~1.5 mm
* Layer 7 can be 2 or 1.5mm based on desired high profile height ~7.5mm or ~8 mm or to provide an accent piece. 
* Laser cutting services I have used for prototypes are [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) and [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/) 
    * Make sure to follow design instructions when placing an order, including available stock sizes and kerf values. 
        * learn more about kerf [here](http://www.cutlasercut.com/resources/tips-and-advice/what-is-laser-kerf#:~:text=in%20a%20drawing-,What%20does%20kerf%20mean%3F,type%20and%20other%20conditional%20factors.)
