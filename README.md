*Why no ISO plate support?* 
* I use ANSI layout and didn't want unnecessary plate cutouts. 
    * It may be added at a later date 
## Producing this case 
* Ensure scaling is set to millimeters 
    * approximate case dimensions are 150.98 mm x 372.37 mm
* each piece is annotated in the .DXF files with their thicknesses and organized by layer from top to bottom 
    * all case layers should be 2mm acrylic, however one of the high profile base layers can be 1.5mm thick of a material of your choosing to provide an accent piece 
    * Switch plate should be 1.5mm thick 
        * By using the accent layer option, this decreases the high profile height from ~8mm to ~7.5mm 
* Laser cutting services I have used for prototypes are [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) and [SendCutSend](https://sendcutsend.com/)
    * Make sure to follow design instructions when placing an order, including available stock sizes and kerf values.
